Hello Daniel!

Welcome to your iHome!

Your living experience starts now!

Siiiiick! This is so me.

So hot. So cool. So very individual.

Who is here today and there tomorrow

will find the right accommodation at iHome.

iHome. Ahead of your time!
 
Living on time means completely
furnished apartments

with all the things that globetrotters and digital nomads
(like me) need to relax, live and work,

e.g. the comfort of a fully equipped kitchen.

No tedious shopping. No lugging furniture.
No wall painting. Living on time means saving time.

More time to live. Save time. Live now!
And all this without a long-term contract commitment,

pages of small print and no hidden costs.

Thank you for your purchase!

Temporary living means smarter living.
From entry to departure, everything runs via the app.

Hello Daniel!

You can use my voice for your individual
Adapt authentic experience.

Hello, hello, hello, hello!

Speak like a real Berliner!

I won't let you tell me anything. 

Sick.

Temporary living means living more authentically.
You are as you live. I live therefore I am!

Your lifestyle is you. Here I come completely to myself.
Reflects. Regenerated. Self-optimized.

To then take a relaxed look at the
new Neighbourhood.

There should be... It said something about "outlook"...
 
With your "yes" you book the additional option "window".

Yes!

Thank you for your purchase.

And with the iHome view filter, the
the city to mirror your inner self. 

How do you feel today?

Cheerful? Melancholic? Sad?
Cheerful but not boisterous? You feel disco!

Temporary living means living anywhere.
Anytime.

And at the same time.
So your city also becomes my city in your place!

Paris check!
Hong Kong check!

New York check!
Dubai check!

L.A. check!
Madrid check!

Saigon check!
Amsterdam check!

I want to be authentic
Freed from space and time

My personality
Putting the finishing touches on.

I want to be authentic

Who books an apartment today
Doesn't want to commit for long,

Can only find itself
When he goes the distance. 
 
Needs 5G everywhere
online at any time,

Wants to be without limits,
But with security.
 
I want to be authentic
Freed from space and time

My personality
Putting the finishing touches on.

I want to be authentic
 
Does not want to paint walls
On steep old building stairs

First lug heavy furniture
And sneak to IKEA.
 
Walk to the hardware store five times,
And stand in line forever,

Three hundred toilets
And then buy a kitchen.
 
I want to be authentic
Freed from space and time

My personality
Putting the finishing touches on.
 
Habitually ahead of the times
Your city will also be my home

Exempt from any tax liability:
I live here, I live now, I live for a time.
 
How to find my style
And look for Experience.

On my Confidence
Are you Lokals horny too.
 
So now comes Berlin!
I will roam the hood

and grab me something sweet
and later move on.
 
I want to be authentic
Freed from space and time

My personality
Putting the finishing touches
 
Hairstyle check!

Positive. One's own success is based on positive thinking:
"A positive mindset!"

Positive... Positive... 
Aha!

Move right back in after moving in!

People! People! Guys! That's not my luggage!
Someone took my bag.

The only pants in the ass, the bag gone....
And I can't even get out the door!

 "The best nights are the ones that just happen.
Belsazar is: for light drinks, for unforgettable moments."

Siiiiick! A welcome drink!

Thank you for your purchase. 

Would you like to order another cocktail?

O! Instead of hope better to "place an order"! 

Place order.
Thank you for using the iHome ordering service.

What can I do for you?

One pair of pants in my size please!

Thank you for your purchase.
 
Sick.

Cha. Pants in exactly my size!

Please rate your order.

Five stars for comedy.

Do you want to continue shopping?

Yes. Pants 38 sizes smaller would be appropriate.

Thank you for your purchase.

Sick.

Do you want to continue shopping?

Shit! Shit! Shit!

Thank you for your purchase.

Thank you for your purchase.

And?

Your order will be processed by our
Contractors made individually for you.

And?

Your order was announced electronically.

Positive. Positive. Well.

If I can't realize myself outside,
then I have to do it inside.

Dwelling is the basic trait of being.

My home is my castle! My home is me.

And I'm all mixed up. 

To have order in our lives,
we need order in our home.

When we simplify our circumstances,
we can communicate more clearly with all

other aspects of ourselves:
our finances, hobbies, relationships, feelings,

Community, spirituality and physical needs.

Pause. I can't go to the bathroom in public....
 
Rinse.

Rinse.

Rinse!

If you want to flush the toilet,
book the premium package now.

However, it is a bit tighter here than in the ad.

Come on: Positive Mindset!
Please, play yoga playlist - 27.

Nothing strengthens the inner order like yoga.
By mastering your own body

I am the master of my own destiny.

Stretching exercises straighten me up and let me
reach for the highest goals.

Breathing exercises ground me and bring me closer
to my personal truth.

To what is important. To myself.

With yoga I bring my inner light to shine
and silence my negative thoughts.

The Downward Dog connects me with my inner 
Energy center and focuses my power.

The tree strengthens the balance.
The breath invigorates me with pure, fresh air.

Sick...

Music from. 

Turn on the shower.

Ah! Hair oil! Siiiick!

Where's the damn shampoo?

Curd soap?

Shower water off.

Hey! Turn on the shower! Water go! 

To help our planet,
we want to save energy together.

iHome also makes its contribution.

That is why with us the shower is only
possible once a day.

Thank you for your help with climate protection!

Please... Once the premium package....

Thank you for your purchase!

I have been living as a full-time nomad for five years.

I work in online marketing, but have
also own projects.

I run a blog about vegan nutrition,
work for other bloggers as a content manager. 

In addition, I have turned to coaching
and advise other digital nomads,

who are just starting out, who want my freedom:

Work when they want, where they want,
and then the feeling of adventure: 

See new places and move from city to city.

From the system I have deregistered and
live in the same country for a maximum of 180 days.

This also saves me from having to file a tax return.
This gives me the freedom to travel around the world.

My jet setting culture
Is pure hedonism.

Whether megalithic structure,
Whether old stone figure

From Bali's high culture,
And whether new steel sculpture,

And whether old sundial:
In the end they are only

The base for the
Computer keyboard

We are the
Digital nomads

Sailing in the Gulf of Aden.
Desert Night,

the palace of the Umayyads
and the Pleiades

My new beard hairstyle
While I was navigating the Nile.

The dinosaur track,
In MŸlheim an der Ruhr,

The Rocket Tour.
And also the intimate shave

During the Antarctic tour:
Wherever I went

Are culture, nature
Good for posting only

We are the
Digital nomads

Here you can see me bathing
with whales and dorades

under cicadas
and here in the health food store

We are the
Digital nomads

Hidden behind facades
Here I eat roulades 

Need to charge my phone

We are the
Digital nomads

With Segway in Bertechsgaden
In leather pants with tight calves

While swinging in the Bonsaigarden
Doraden can be braden

I am slowly losing the thread

Loneliness,
Death,

Time,
The reality

Fear,
the envy
The downside of this lifestyle is likely,
that I do not have my own apartment,

no place of safety to go to,
when you've had a bad day. 

Sometimes you feel tired and drained,
has no more energy or gets sick

and just wants to lie down. Lie down. 

Music from.

Music from 

But where are my pants...?


Hey Daniel! How's it going?

We're sorry to see that your work-score
has fallen below zero.

What?

Because we value you and your contribution, we're
gonna give you one free day to earn back your points.

Otherwise, your work account will be automatically terminated.

But I pressed save!

This is the worst iHome ever!

Positive... positive...

Stress. Pressure. 

That's not part of my lifestyle.
I don't let work blackmail me:

Self-Care. Work-Life-Balance. Wellness.
Those are my priorities.

Why should I stress myself!
There are lots of jobs! 

One million more jobs than people.

In Germany alone, more than
seven million employees retire.

This tears gaps.
Bottlenecks are the result,

in the health sector, in the craft sector,
in the service industry. 

90 percent of positions unfilled!
Why should I stress myself out?

Sure, most of it will be automated soon.

Peter Thiel says we should worry more about
about too little automation than about too much.

Self-driving cars. Artificial intelligence.
Elon Musk. 

This is all natural, because it frees people!
Like the self-cleaning apartment from iHome! Here!

Clears away by itself! Zack! 

The cleaning lady is happy!
She can do whatever she wants.

It does not matter at all! 
THAT is democracy! 

THAT is freedom! 
The abolition of the cleaning lady! 

The abolition of work. 

Then the whole of humanity moves away digitally nomadic.

The production produces itself! 
The supplies deliver themselves! 

Even the pants host itself! 

Wait a minute... 

Where are my pants?

What does this iHome have?

Where is my bag? My coat? 

My pants?

I have no time 

Stitch after stitch!
Seam by seam!

I rush me
Cut by cut!
 
Turn the wheel,
Keep up the momentum!

Each kick
Keeps me young!
 
The collars are ready.

No time!

Missed everything in life - skirted:
- Shirts, pants, collars -

At the same time not slept, much less dreamed 
Dreams are not for the stomach.
 
Too little, too late
And in debt, for the most part:

So I'm all sewn up on the edge:
Until the thread breaks.

I have no time

For three days

White collars
One hundred layers undefeated...
 
Come in, sir...
Oh, what's his name!

Half past seven sharp the
Intermediate Master: 
 
The sleeves are ready

No time!

Just sewed a shirt - too late:
- morning, noon, evening -

So I reel off here at this device. 
 
Lied to the hilt, bruised
My heart is pumping for the clock,
 
 Delivers time now as money
To the manufactory. 
 
I have no time

Stitch by stitch
Seam by seam

I rush me 
Cut by cut 

For three days 

White collars
One hundred layers undefeated... 
 
Come in, sir...
Oh, what's his name!

Half past seven sharp the
Intermediate Master:

Do you want a clear one? 
Am experienced: 

New goods
For ten years. 
 
The 20s! A decade to throw away!
 
I have no time

No time

Hello? Hello?

Sorry but... 
Here. Hello!

What are you doing in the fridge!

Hello Daniel. 

Your voice!

I didn't know we were already doubling up.

Oh, sorry, that was not intentional.

You are with iHome, yes?

No. With the KPD.

KPD? Customer Product Service?
Cool.

Has iHome outsourced the service?
No matter. You are the landlord, yes?

Yes.

Nice to meet you.

Could you turn off the machine for a moment
for a moment, it's easier to talk.

Not.

Okay, so I would have a little feedback:

Their "cost-cutting" measures are,
service-wise, counterproductive.

No shower water! No toilet flush!
Not even a mattress!

And you have countless bugs in the system!

Bugs are everywhere. They are naked.

My pants!

Pimped! Full vintage. 

Siiiiick! Berlin ik come! 

Hold on.

Oh. Yeah. Sure.
Complete purchase.

I do this through the app...

Or Paypal? Venmo? Google Wallet? Bitcoin?

How about money.

Cash. Ah. Oldschool. 

Also the hairstyle. So I have money. 

How much does it make?

Five hundred and seventy-three.

Five hundred... what?

For the few seams?

Inflation.

Inflation. Ah, yes. I see.

So don't worry. I have cash. 

I had cash... 

I had money in my pants, they had my pants. 

Where is my money?

Your "money"! We are not here in Hinterpommern.

Excuse me?

You probably thought you could fool me with the flowers!

Blossoms? What are you talking about? Where is my money?

The wallpaper had come down. Paper costs!

But not a thousand euros!

Euro?

Yes. The one currency for a united Europe. 

How now! With the Polacks? 

No wonder it's not worth anything. 

Now I have to move on here. 
The pants are on credit.

Hey hey hey!

But this does not look healthy.

If you keep this up,
then you will have a burnout very quickly. 

I am also coach you know, 
i give them free advice -

No time. No advice.

Not having time is a choice.

Aha? I am at a loss.

Yes. You need to take time. For yourself.

I see. Then I'll stop the wheel now.

Very good- ... 

What... What are you doing?

Taking time for myself.

All wheels stand still when your strong arm wills it.

But... This is my bed!

From 11 to 4. Otherwise, the bed is mine.

But... This is not iShare, but iHome. This is my home.

Your accommodation.

I live here!

You live here.

But I am the tenant!

The Sleeping Boy.

The what?

Sleeper.

Rented in.

Sleeping indoors by the hour.
Work for hours elsewhere.

Shit! The work!

What on earth are you doing?

Set up my office.

Your office?

I'm in the home office. 

They are in the way! There's only room for one here! 
No homework here!

Not home office! Home Office! 
Home office is something completely different. 

Home office is the order of the day. 
Do not lose time in traffic! 

No silly chatter at the coffee machine! 
Home Office is the here and now. 

Total freedom! 

Home office is no-pants-wearing-have-to! 

Did you say something? 

No!

Sew between the bed and the kitchen. 
Glue bags. Brush dials. 

Pay for the materials yourself. 
The room too! 

And if you ever get sick! 
At the mercy of the arbitrariness of capital!

Did you say something?
 
YES!

Here I am locked up
I see it the other way around.

Here at home, I'm collecting my wages today.
Shut your mouth, no work, no money!

Without any hassle, I just make money online.
And so you pollute the air and the world.

People from Sydney, Calcutta, and Algiers,
Come home to us via team chat!!!

Stay away from me, I hardly have any room left here myself!
Krethi and Plethi, Hans Wurst, Hinz and Kunz!

Sleeping boys rent my bed by day
only at night I myself may also times...

Time management is then the most important issue,
Home office becomes the solution of choice!

Nothing remains private anymore, my home is factory!
Work becomes home, becomes life, how chic!

Even as a corpse I remain productive!
Home office is just highly effective!

Home office, home office, only makes you free!
Home work, home work, never over...

Don't even wear a tie to work!

Zero days off, not even Sundays off,
Home work, home work is never over.

Never again by commuter rail.
And the pay doesn't seem very fair either!

No more standing in traffic jams at half past seven in the morning! No!
Never be alone, monitored at all times!
 
Home work, home work, never over...
Home office, home office, only makes you free!

I have been living as a full-time nomad for five years.
For me, however, it's not about traveling.

For me, it's about freedom. Not about that,
roads, but to experience them. 

Expanding my view. 
Mastering the world. 

Be knowledgeable in it. Without obligation.
Without connection. Free.

Up there the airspace. Uncontrolled.
Ungoverned. Being. 

To live there would be to live truly free.
Man as the shepherd of sheer being.... 

By 2050, Elon Musk wants to have a colony for
build a million people on Mars. 

But what does that mean for people? 
The Old High German word for build, 

'buan', bui, bŸren, beuren, beuron, means the living. 

Building is living and living is the basic trait of being, 
is the way we mortals are on earth. 

The mortals dwell, inasmuch as we the divines 
than the divine expect. Dwelling also means 

"to be needed for peace" means: 
"to remain enclosed in the frye", i.e. "in the open" ...

...how the airship flies along and ten winds behind it 
and how the clouds on both sides as marching columns

 and fog towers slowly change and like 
down a hundred mountains, into a giant snake 

grown together, with the poison of their lava flows
and avalanches angrily between the 

Ants congresses of people lie - 

and how you don't notice anything up in the silent holy region,
what squawks and swells down below.

Where do I live? I said.

I glided warmly blown on an incalculable silver,
from the stars beaten to delicate foam

seas flowing together further - a sea, soft and
white like snow mist, like the scent of light - 

all the windows of my hut shimmered - I was all lit up. 
- I sailed in the over the night earth 

cloudy sky, 
in whose tide the risen moon

like a swan with its shiny plumage
He stood, shining through all the waves, before he flew out into the blue.

as part of allotment garden use in the sense of the 

Sublease are bedding areas, 

Fruit trees and berry bushes. 

At the same time, the cultivation of fruit and vegetables must
as a distinction from other garden forms 

give the allotment garden its character and 
amount to at least one third of the garden area.

What grows here is for food. 
From immigrants. Refugees. Swabia. 

Last year alone are almost a hundred thousand hungry mouths
more moved to the imperial capital Berlin. 

They all want to be stuffed!

This is called "market"! 

Growth, Growth! 

Great, we need growth! 
But intelligent! I have an idea! 

Does it have to do with coconuts?

The new Berliner wants honest, fresh food. 
Regional, seasonal, social, climate-neutral. 

But who has his own garden? 
Who would have the time to take care of it! 

We are true pioneers with our world's first online garden. 

We are building a digital bridge between our customers and their
and the garden. 

iGarden! 

This is the garden 4.0, the online garden with the real yield!

Those who came to Berlin were looking for work or protection.

Immigration was mostly so-called opportunity migration,
Driven by the search for better earning opportunities

or any livelihood at all. 
 
Plant your own plot from the comfort of your home
with the click of a mouse.
 
The largest industrial and commercial
Service city of Germany easier to find

than in smaller towns or in the countryside.
 
We equip every iGarden with live cam and vital sensors.
 
However, the newcomers were mostly unskilled
and therefore mainly as a worker

active in the construction industry and in the catering trade. 
 
Seeds and pre-pulled plants are produced by the 
iGardenFarmer*in - that would be you, Miss Plštzke! 

- according to your wishes - i.e. those of the customers
 - brought into the appropriate sections. 

Join us and rent your iGarden.

The majority of the immigrants were women.
They found work as servants and in the clothing industry ... 
 
iGarden brings the garden into the living room!
 
About one-third of the employees in this "industry"
are home workers.
 
Who combines the playful with the useful, 
can release enormous dynamics!

Miss Plštzke, listen to the customers streaming in!
Pushing each other, outdoing each other!

They're already kicking the crap out of us! 

Who are you?

This is the new sleeper. Also foreigner.

The Russians are coming. 

He is punctual. From 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.
After that I sleep there.

And me? Where should I sleep then?
Where should I live then? 

And what's with this giant luggage! 

Sh! 

You will not sleep again until you can pay. 

From 4 to 24 pm.

This is the worst iHome ever...

Excuse me?

Aren't you a little tight like that? 

It seems to me that your piano wants to go a little crazy?

Excuse me? Hello? Hello!
 
SHHHH!!!!!! Sleeping.

Exactly. 

What is it?

Soup.

I mean what's inside.

Cabbage. Water. 

Hmm. Vegan.

For a woman with little money you have
already a lot of stuff. 

Is there still room for a bit of your own world?

Clearly, living is always already a stay with things. 

The next step along this path would be to ask:
what about housing in our precarious times? 

There is talk everywhere and with reason about the housing shortage.
You don't just talk, you lend a hand. 

Attempts are being made to alleviate the hardship by procuring housing, 
through the promotion of housing construction, 

by planning the whole building system. 

So hard and bitter, so inhibiting and threatening 
the shortage of housing remains, 

the real need for housing is
not only in the lack of housing. 

The actual housing shortage is also
older than the world wars and destruction, 

older also than the increase of the population on earth
and the situation of the industrial worker. 

The real need for housing does not exist only
In the lack of housing. 

The real housing shortage is based in this, 
that you first have to learn how to live. 

The real hardship of living is thinking. 

In Mindset.

Never alone. 

One side of the proletarian fate of all countries will be 
never described - 

namely the tragedy that lies in it, 
that the proletarian is never alone.

Such is his life:

He is born in the hospital,
where many mothers give birth, 

or in a room, 
where immediately the family with their appendix, 

the sleeping boy, swarming around him; that's how he grows up,
 
That's his world; he's never alone. Not at home. 

Still, when he dies...

he either dies in such a greasy hole
or in the hospital - 

and even then is not alone. 

It is not said that "people are used to this". 

To a life like that, where you're never alone, 
you don't get used to it; you live it bitterly to the end.

Here lie not only the bodies together - 
here also the souls evaporate, 

and because there is not enough room for any of them, so they pull
together and become cramped, crowded, sometimes small.

...this apartment is located in the north of Berlin,
a whole family has taken up residence here, 

and a horse as a sleeping boy is also there - 
but you can't see it on this picture: 

it went to work. 
But: there is still a big difference if it looks like this.

Or like this.

How much courage, how much energy is involved, 
to still hope to work under such low ceilings, 

not the idea of class struggle 
to let dimly glow! 

Is the proletarian not very strong, 
he is not imbued with the thought, 

to fight for his class, then that very world comes into being: 
"Third transverse building, right, second courtyard"....

Class comrades should be in solidarity and 
work and live collectively, certainly. 

But is there not a human being, 
that wants to be more than just a working engine, 

reproductive apparatus and digestive machine, and the 
would not wish to be alone once, just once?

This house, for example, has six yards, 
and six hundred families live here, 

coming and going, shouting and calling, 
cook and wash, and all hear everything, 

each takes part in the fate of the other on the 
most sensitive way in which this is possible: 

namely with the ear. 

The ear of the proletarian learns soundlessness
only know in solitary confinement.

How if the homelessness of man consisted in this,
that man is the real housing shortage 

not yet even considered the need? 

However, as soon as man considers homelessness, 
it is already no longer a misery. 

She is, quite thoughtful and well kept, the only 
Assurance that calls mortals into dwelling. 

Siiiick! Can he play! 
 
I buy myself a rocket
And fly to Mars

And I fall down again
Does everyone ask me "How was Mars, 

On Mars?

Mars, 
on Mars?

Mars, 
on Mars?

On Mars!"

Get a' pile of dough
From grandpa, then save it

And buy yourself a rocket
And come to me to Mars, to Mars

To Mars?

To Mars,
to Mars?

To Mars, to Mars, to Mars!

It makes a hiss in the front and a bang in the back
Already I fly around the neck of Venus

Wail up my creditors:
"Pay the debt!", I say, "Come on up!"

Do you want to be rid of your bride once
At the edge of the altar

Then put them in a bomb
And shoot them up to Mars to Mars

To Mars?

To Mars,
to Mars?

To Mars, to Mars, to Mars!

It makes a fizzle in the front and a bang in the back
Already I fly around the neck of Venus

Wail up my creditors:
"Pay the debt!", I say, "Come on up!".

Get a' pile of dough
From grandpa, then save it

And buy yourself a rocket
And come to me to Mars, to Mars

To Mars?

To Mars,
to Mars!

Until 8 o'clock the bed is still mine now.
From 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., they sleep there. 

And you... 

If they have money again in the time in between.
Meanwhile: Time is money. 

Painting dials. You'll get the hang of it.
Take 	a look: 

Brush, radium luminous paint, dial.
Brush carefully tap into the paint,

sharpen briefly between the lips,
and then finely brush the numbers.

Wipe off excess color on hand.
Burns a bit at first, but glows quite nicely at night.

You can't see a thing!

Time cannot be seen.

I see.

Bright head.

Thank you

This lights up at night. 
There is one penny per dial. 

The best girls manage two hundred a day.

What does the clock say?

She says tick-tock. 

No window. Nothing. No light. No day. 

Tick-tock.

What does the clock say?

Tick-Tack. Tick. Tack. And goes in circles.

In this hole. 

Tick-tock.

What does the clock say?

Tick-tock she says. We are circled.

From time.

And have none. 
 
What does the clock say?

Tack Tick.

Tack tick? That's where the clock ticks. 

A window in time! Tack tick.

And spasms in woe. And cries:

Time rots and cracks at the same time. 
The condition is wretched or base, 

the way out crooked. 
No doubt, however, his end will not be bourgeois.

Now we have a hole in the roof!
 
...everything flows. 

Termination due to non-payment... 
Despite multiple requests... 

Vattenfall... for the year...1922! 

Didn't you pay for the electricity, Miss Plštzke?

What kind of aristocratic circles do you move in? 
the gentleman then usually? 

Ha! Electricity in the tenement... 
 
What about housing in our precarious times? 

There is talk everywhere and with reason about the housing shortage. 

You don't just talk, you lend a hand. 

Attempts are being made to alleviate the hardship by procuring housing, 
through the promotion of housing construction, 

by planning the whole building system. 

So hard and bitter, so inhibiting and threatening 
the shortage of housing remains, 

the real need for housing does not exist only 
In the lack of housing. 

The actual housing shortage is also older than the world wars 
and the destruction, 

older also because the increase in the population 
on earth and the position of the industrial worker. 

The real plight of housing rests in this, 
that mortals know the essence of dwelling 

always have to search again, that they first have to learn how to live.
 
What does the clock say? 
You are how you live. 

Tick-tock. 

I am a hole. 

Here I come completely to myself. 
Have I always been this tight? 

Narrow and cold. Day and night. 
Windowless. What does the clock say? 

The temporality that constitutes me, 
be the assets, 

the space through memory and anticipation 
to be included in the time, 

to give meaning to the space. 

Is that me?

No time. No feeling! 

I don't identify with my bank balance. 

That's not me! 

I deserve pants! 

A window in time! 

A hole! 

How do I get out?

Where is the door! 

Where is the damn door! 

Positive... positive...
 
Shit: Positive... 

Siiick! This is too much. 

I have to get out of here.

One stroke too many. 

I can't breathe.             

Hold your breath. 

I can't breathe! 

Respiratory distress. 

Housing shortage. 

Tick-tock. 

That's not me!  

Displaced.

A hole! 

Apartments built for a family, 
are now divided into four, sometimes five studio apartments, 

divided, rented individually, by the day.
By the hour! 

Live on time! Tight and clammy!

Rising rents, dubious service charges,
senseless modernizations, heating failure in winter:

Real estate companies such as Deutsche Wohnen, 

Vonovia, Akelius and Co are mainly responsible 
for the rent madness.

Their business model is profit at our expense.

...I have built ahead.
Switched to shares at an early stage...

Rents in Berlin have risen in the last few years.
doubled in the last ten years. 

Wages have barely risen in the same period.

People live stacked, pressed, stuffed into
smaller and smaller apartments.

But now the time has come! 

Tack-Tick! No door! 
 
Long enough we have been stacking, pressing,
stuffed, now the roofs are bursting open, 

highlight the humiliated tenants! 

Prospects open up! Hope! 
Every person has the right to adequate housing!

A window in time! 

Workers! Proles! 

At last, the cartels and trusts appear in their
final effect on the capitalist economy

virtually as one of the means they themselves use to enlarge
of their own anarchy, 

for the resolution of the contradictions it contains,
created to hasten its own demise. 
 
Where is the door!

We must take to the streets! 
 
We want to make history and for the first time
Bring Article 15 of the Basic Law to bear!

And get some fresh air!

A historic window of opportunity!

Recreation now!

We want our houses back! 

Breathing for all!

We finally want to have a say!

Fresh air!

We fight for everyone to live safer!

...and can go to the health food store.
 
...that everyone lives healthier!

...and more sustainable.

...that everyone lives more beautifully! It's time! 

It's time!

Be ready! 

Be ready!

To die!

What?

To die!

Why now, "die"?!

You do not wear the revolution on your lips
to talk about her, 

but in the heart to die for them.

You don't want to fight? 

Standing up against oppression and exploitation?

Yes, I did! I donated and signed at Campact... 

Class fathers. The main thing that ours stuffs you
for nothing the holes in your pants! 

The new Berlin! Always on top,
even if it's on the gallows of monopoly capital! 

But just you wait. We build the movement
again from below. 

We go to the root of the evil! Thoroughly! 

We go underground. 
'Order reigns in Berlin!' 

You dull henchmen! 
Your 'order' is built on sand. 

And that is why the future victory will blossom from this defeat.


Enemy storms rage through the air,
 looming clouds obscure the light.

 May pain and death now await us,
 against the enemies calls on us the duty.

 We have the shining flame of freedom
 high above our heads:

 the flag of victory, of the liberation of peoples,
 that leads us safely into the final battle 

Onward, onward now to the bloody, holy battle.
 Conquer the enemies, you working people.

 To the barricades, to the barricades,
 Storm the world, you working people! 

Death and destruction to all oppressors,
 suffering people is our deed,

 turns against them the murdering weapons,
 That they may reap their own seed!

 Fertilized with workers' blood is the earth,
 give your blood for the last war,

 that mankind may be redeemed!
 Solemnly approaches the holy victory.
 
Onward, onward now to the bloody, holy battle.
 Conquer the enemies, you working people.

 To the barricades, to the barricades,
 Storm the world, you working people!

Misery and hunger corrupt us all,
 against the enemies calls admonishingly the need,

 Struggle for freedom and happiness for mankind!
 Struggling youth are not frightened by death.

The dead, the great idea died,
 millions will be holy.

 Arise then, brothers, comrades,
 Take up arms and close your ranks! 

Onward, onward now to the bloody, holy battle.
 Conquer the enemies, you working people.

 To the barricades, to the barricades,
 Storm the world, you working people!

The revolution will already 'rattling tomorrow 
pointing upwards again'. 

and proclaim to your terror with the sound of a trumpet:

I was!

I am!

I will be!

You should embrace failure, Miss Plštzke. 

When things do not fail,
you were not innovative enough. 

Defeats are occasions for inner growth. 
"...making history." 

You can wait a long time for it. 
History does not exist, only stories. 

Experience. Individual.

The Russians are coming.

My pants! 

Pants in a form comparable to today's were 
among nomadic and equestrian peoples such as the Scythians, 

Sarmatians and Dacians worn, 
but also by Chinese and Mongolians. 

The oldest specimen of riding pants to date 
was found as part of a burial set in the Yanghai burial ground 

found near Turfan and await the end of 
of the second millennium before Christ.

Siiick! 

This is so me! 

I am Plan B! 

Not a one-planet personality!

I am a multiplanetary nomad! 

Where do I live? I said. 

I glided warmly blown on a 
incalculable silver, 

from the stars beaten to delicate foam 
confluent seas further - 

a sea, soft and white like snow mist, 
like the scent of light - I was completely enlightened. 

Without commitment. Without connection. Free.

The closer I get to the people scurrying by, 
the smaller and sadder this world becomes. 

Mankind is an immature species: 
deformed, crooked, greasy. 

They make step by step and do not know where to go and why. 

They are there and they are not.

On Mars, life must first be 
gradually set in motion,
 
so that in 100 years a blade of grass might be 
sprouts from its rocky soil. 

However, a new model of life is then created there. 

An original lifestyle: 

Live more beautifully on Mars! 

Reflects. Regenerated. Self-optimized. 

Everyone should be shot into space once. 

Only when we move away from the earthly 
we will succeed in creating within ourselves a 

unshakeable home. 

Your lifestyle is you. 
I live therefore I am.

Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three two, one....

Bye, Berlin! 

Alpha Centauri, here I come! 

I am a great step for humankind. 
I am the future. I am gone!
      
Hello, I am John Nijenhuis. 

Yes. Please listen carefully, the next person is already calling. 

The studio is located on the 3rd floor - without elevator and windows-. 
there is a bed, a garden, a bathroom, a magic chamber. 

No kitchen. Roommates? 

About 47, but they are only there in the evening. 

Moment. Hold on. Not so fast. 

From you we would then immediately need a 
Proof of income for the next five years, 

the bank statements of the last three, SCHUFA anyway 
and twice the signed guarantees of both parents, 

with notarized copies of their pension statements. 

You can bring the urine sample until 21:00 
and now I really have to go. 

A tour? 

We cannot allow that, 
but please do not worry about that. 

You won't get the apartment anyway.

Hello Aja.

THE END
